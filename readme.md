The file "final.R" contains the R script that performs the following (comments describing the code are also included within the script):

All files are read from the data folders.

The files are then converted to dataframes with their names changed.

Train and test datasets are merged for X and y files.

Activity labels are matched to their description

The variables that calculate mean and standard deviations are identified.

A tidy dataset that contains the subject, the activity and the means and standard deviations measurements is created.

A second tidy dataset is created that contains the mean for each variable, for each subject and for each activity.

The files first_tidy_dataset.csv and tidy_dataset contain the initial (mean and standard deviations measurements) and final (averages summarized per subject and per activity).
